# Arch Linux Calamares Installer or ALCI

Use the correct version for building the iso.

Read the archiso.readme.

Download the content of the github with (in terminal)

git clone https://github.com/arcolinuxiso/alci-iso

Change the content of archiso/packages.x86-64 or not.

Change the content of archiso/airootfs/etc/pacman.conf or not.
You can add the ArcoLinux repos or the Chaotic-aur repos or so many others.

Start building your own ALCI version with the scripts in the folder

installation-scritps

You will get an iso in the ~/Alci-Out.

Burn it and use it.

Still not sure what to do

Check out the playlist on Youtube

Want to have a /etc/pacman.conf with the repos you like, add it to the the folder /airootfs/etc/
and it will be on your future system.
